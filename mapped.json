The straps don't make it easy to move with 2 cameras attached to this thing without fear of one of them swinging into a wall or person. The design is not thoughtful of anyone who wants to actually have any sort of mobility while wearing this. I wouldn't buy this again. And I would return it, if I could.",

I'm not upset about the plastic feel of the leather at all and it does what I need when I need it. Couldn't ask for much more then that. I'm happy with it so far.",

If you are going to use this with the intent of not unhooking the camera/s during your shoot this'll work. But if you intend to remove the camera (e.g. for extreme angles, etc.) keep looking. The sleeve that screws in and out to tighten and loosen has to be loosened just right, not too far, or it won't open to release the camera. A bit frustrating if you remove the camera a lot.",
